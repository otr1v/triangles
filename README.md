# DEMO VERSION of task Triangles 
## What does it do :
finding an intersection between list of triangles in 3D (not correctly for all tests)

### Current state 
This project shows the development of my skills. It's a shame even for me right now.

Development and contributing to this project is now stopped. Code is really dirty. Don't recommend to see the code if you have weak nervous system and deep knowledge of C++.
